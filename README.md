# 🌐 UNESCO World Heritage Sites recommender system

## What is a World Heritage Site (WHS)? 🏯

A [**World Heritage Site**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site) is a landmark or area with legal protection by an international convention administered by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). World Heritage Sites are designated by UNESCO for having cultural, historical, scientific or other form of significance. The sites are judged to contain "cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity".


## Project: Goals & Steps 🎯
This is a final project for the [AllWomen Academy](https://www.allwomen.tech/) Data Science Immersive Course. 
This project aimed to analyze the data related to the World Heritage Sites (2022) and build a WHS recommender system.

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Data Analytics**: EDA, Data Cleaning, and Data Visualization.
2. **Machine Learning**: building a machine learning model (using the KNN algorithm) to recommend sites based on similarity in terms of their descriptions. (NLP algorithms have been used as well, for the text cleaning process of the WHS descriptions).

Finally, I have built an application on Streamlit to display the recommender system and allow the user to play with the results. The app is available [here](https://elenabat-whs-recommende-recommendersystem-streamlit-test-9ko9t4.streamlitapp.com/).

## Dataset 🗒️
The original dataset used for this purpose has been downloaded from the official [World Heritage Sites List 2022](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/).
